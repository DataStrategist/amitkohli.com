## Hello! Welcome!

My name is Amit, and I'm one of those eternal learners. These days, I spend most of my work time (and a fair amount of my leisure time) playing around in the "data space". There is so much power available, it's truly incredible what we can do these days (and yet, it seems so many people are locked out of this transformation, but let's not get into that just yet). 

I love [R](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/three-mighty-good-reasons-to-learn-r-for-data-science/), and use it to do all manner of things. I'm also paying close attention to "New AI", like LLMs (GPT-3, Bloom, etc) and image generators (mid Journey, DALL-E2, etc). If it's not data, it's either "maker stuff" (I'm currently infatuated with CNC mills and laser-cutters), or video games or trying to find someone to throw a frisbee at.

Professionally, it's hard to describe who I am. I tend to work for "for-good" initiatives like NGOs, governments, UN, and the like. As you can imagine, they don't have budgets for big data teams, so I tend to do a bit of everything... and as I mature in my career, I am not only the "tech person", but I'm also the person raising the human concerns about tech. I describe myself as a "Senior Data Scientist", or as a "data transformationalist", or as a "system builder". Bah, I don't know what I am. I fed my Resume to GPT-3 and this is what it thought I was:

> This man has a resume that looks like he has a lot of experience in the field of data and technology. He has worked with various organizations, both in the private and public sectors, and has a lot of experience in managing and developing data strategies. He is also a skilled teacher and has experience in training others in data and technology.

(let's step over the fact that I only fed it bullet-points and never said I was male, but it guessed my gender from my profile. Anyway). 

Specifically, this is what I've done:

<a href="notData/timeline.PNG"><img src = "../notData/timeline.PNG"></a>


But perhaps more interestingly, this representation perhaps shows the _why_ I became who I am (zoom in, click and play around... this viz is interactive!):

<iframe src = "../notData/path.html" width = "600px" height = "900px"></iframe>

## about this blog

One definition of art is "everything done for self-expression". I like that definition. Using that definition, this blog is my artwork. Some posts are analyses, some are providing tools for analysis, and "a mishmash" of other stuff.
