Greetings! 

My name is Amit Kohli. I'm a Mexican/Indian that grew up hopping around South America and then settled in USA where I became an environmental engineer. In 2005 I "wanted more", so after a 6-month world trip, I got my MSc which landed me a job with the UN in Rome. There I became much more interested in systems building and data management. That led me to a Data Director job with a large NGO in Ghana and the UK, and now I'm settled in London where I am a data freelancer in the #data4good space.

I believe in helping and minimizing suffering worldwide. I have spent my entire professional life trying to do this via UN/NGOs and by teaching. If you know of a way I can help more, please do get in touch.

I am addicted to learning and want to do everything and am "writing a book" about that.

## about this blog

One definition of art is "everything done for self-expression". I like that definition. Using that definition, this blog is my artwork. Some posts are analyses, some are providing tools for analysis, and a bunch of other topics. 

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is my main weapon of choice and the main tool discussed in this blog. I also have released some libraries for R:
 - [ShinyTester](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ShinyTester/index.html) 
 - [TileMaker](https://github.com/DataStrategist/TileMaker)
 - [BulletChartR](https://github.com/ACDIVOCATech/bulletchartr)

## Professionally, who am I?

One way to understand who I am, is by tracking my professional expertise:

But perhaps more interestingly, this representation perhaps shows the _why_ of the changes:
