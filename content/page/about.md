Greetings! I'm an environmental engineer that changed focus from remediation and design to data analysis, dissemination and visualization. Now I'm focusing on data for decision-making, so dashboards, adaptive management, KPIs and the like, specializing in the international development sector.

R is my main weapon of choice and the main tool discussed in this blog. I also have released some libraries for R:
 - [ShinyTester](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ShinyTester/index.html) 
 - [TileMaker](https://github.com/DataStrategist/TileMaker)
 - [BulletChartR](https://github.com/ACDIVOCATech/bulletchartr)

Lastly, I also [blog at work](https://www.acdivoca.org/data-digest). 

 - My interests:
  * water resources and national level water use
  * development
  * data-management
  * art / music /movies
  * the maker movement
