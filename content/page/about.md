Greetings! I&#8217;m an environmental engineer that changed focus from remediation and design to data analysis, dissemination and visualization. Now I&#8217;m focusing on data for decisionmaking, so dashboards, adaptive management, KPIs and the like. My interests:

  * water resources and national level water use
  * development
  * data management
  * art /music
  * the maker movement
