I have presented at multiple venues internationally. It's true that I do like the sound of my own voice :), but I like speaking because it provides a good opportunity to make a statement about something I know about, and then to see what other views exist. In some cases, the people that come up to speak to me after the talk are introverted and wouldn't quite feel comfortable asking questions in public, but I have learned great things from the contacts and friends I've earned by public speaking. You should present as well!
