<p>Greetings! I’m an environmental engineer that changed focus from remediation and design to data analysis, dissemination and visualization. Now I’m focusing on data for decision-making, so dashboards, adaptive management, KPIs and the like, specializing in the international development sector.</p>
<p>R is my main weapon of choice and the main tool discussed in this blog. I think its the best thing since sliced bread and present about it frequently. My latest talks are:</p>
