A visualization prepared for FAO AQUASTAT:

In an interest to simplify the information about renewable water resources in all countries in the world, we prepared simplified visualizations of water flows through a country.

Please navigate to the [AQUASTAT Water Resources page][2]Â and use the &#8220;Figures&#8221; dropdown to see the flow for each country (as well as the definitions of the abbreviations.
