A visualization generated for AQUASTAT of FAO.

Two types of charts were prepared: Sankey and Network. The Sankey plots allow for an &#8216;automatic sorting&#8217; of countries based on who is the water tower and who is the water source. This visualization is useful to demonstrate where a country falls on this continuum.

The network plot shows the automatic arrangement of countries with their &#8216;water-neighbours&#8217; without being bound to the upstream (left) -> downstream (right) style.

See interactive versions for all continents as well as a detailed analysis on the AQUASTAT page:

OK&#8230; I paste one here only because it&#8217;s extra boing-y:
