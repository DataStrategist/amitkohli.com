Following the footsteps of [this cool post I saw][1] by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/JohnNelsonIDV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JohnNelsonIDV</a>, I wanted to try to and make a map using Excel.

Fast forward 2 days and the opportunity came up. Lo and behold, a Map of Reference Evapotranspiration built in Excel!

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-368" src="https://i2.wp.com/amitkohli.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ET0.png?resize=300%2C188" alt="ET0" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/amitkohli.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ET0.png?resize=300%2C188 300w, https://i2.wp.com/amitkohli.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ET0.png?resize=1024%2C643 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/amitkohli.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ET0.png?resize=700%2C440 700w, https://i2.wp.com/amitkohli.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ET0.png?w=1199 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][2]

Instructions:

  1. Read data file into Excel (skip top rows with metadata), make sure to delimit correctly so that each value is in a column.
  2. Select ALL cells (Ctrl+A twice)
  3. Make column width same as row width
  4. With all selected, add a conditional formatting based on value.
